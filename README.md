This is just a freelance side project I made in 2013. 

It was planned to have two iterations and support period. 
Unfortunately, customer cancelled the project, so only iteration 1 was deployed.
Iteration 2 was completely implemented according to spec, but was never deployed to production, hence branch production
73 commits back master

Consider this as a protfolio item: Django, celery, fabric, bootstrap, LESS, require.js, lots of custom javascript.
I decided not to use angular in the project as I had enough new technologies to learn.
